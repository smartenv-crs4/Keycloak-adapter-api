# üîê Keycloak Adapter API for Node.js (Express)

An adapter API to seamlessly integrate **Node.js Express** applications with **Keycloak** for authentication and authorization using **OpenID Connect (OIDC)**.

This middleware provides route protection, token validation, user role management, and easy access to Keycloak-secured APIs. Ideal for securing RESTful services, microservices, and Express-based backends.

---

## üì¶ Features

- üîë OIDC-based authentication with Keycloak
- üßæ Access token validation (JWT)
- üîê Route protection via role-based access control
- üîÅ Automatic token refresh (optional)
- ‚öôÔ∏è Configurable Keycloak client and realm settings
- üë§ User info extraction from token
- üåç CORS support and integration with frontend apps (SPA or mobile)

---

## üöÄ Installation

```bash
npm install keycloak-adapter-api
```

Or, if using Yarn:

```bash
yarn add keycloak-adapter-api
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

Create a file named `keycloak.json` in the root of your project with the following structure:

```json
{
  "realm": "your-realm",
  "auth-server-url": "https://your-keycloak-domain/auth",
  "ssl-required": "external",
  "resource": "your-client-id",
  "credentials": {
    "secret": "your-client-secret"
  },
  "confidential-port": 0
}
```

> You can also pass the config programmatically (see example below).

---

## üìÑ Usage Example

```js
const express = require('express');
const session = require('express-session');
const Keycloak = require('keycloak-connect');

const app = express();

// Session setup (required by Keycloak middleware)
const memoryStore = new session.MemoryStore();
app.use(session({
  secret: 'some-secret',
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: true,
  store: memoryStore
}));

// Initialize Keycloak adapter
const keycloak = new Keycloak({ store: memoryStore });

// Apply Keycloak middleware
app.use(keycloak.middleware());

// Public route
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Public route: no authentication required');
});

// Protected route (any authenticated user)
app.get('/secure', keycloak.protect(), (req, res) => {
  res.send('Secure route: user is authenticated');
});

// Role-based protected route
app.get('/admin', keycloak.protect('realm:admin'), (req, res) => {
  res.send('Admin route: user has realm role "admin"');
});

// Start the server
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
```

## ‚úÖ Protecting Routes

You can use the following methods to protect routes:

- `keycloak.protect()` ‚Äî any authenticated user
- `keycloak.protect('role')` ‚Äî users with a specific role
- `keycloak.protect('realm:role')` ‚Äî users with realm-level role

---

## üì§ Get User Info

Once authenticated, user info can be accessed via the `req.kauth.grant` object:

```js
app.get('/profile', keycloak.protect(), (req, res) => {
  const token = req.kauth.grant.access_token;
  const userInfo = token.content;
  res.json(userInfo);
});
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- This adapter relies on `keycloak-connect` under the hood.
- Make sure Keycloak client type is set to **confidential**.
- The `keycloak.json` must match the configuration from your Keycloak admin panel.

---

## üß™ Testing

You can use tools like **Postman** or **curl** to test the secured endpoints. Obtain a token from Keycloak and include it as a Bearer token in the Authorization header.

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <access_token>" http://localhost:3000/secure
```
